# spiralVisualizer
Processing Audio Visualizer in the form of a spiral.

This project utilizes Processing as well as Minim, which is a library that allows users to process sound waves coming from microphones or music files.

I then formed the spiral using native sine functions as well as a typical spiral equation.
